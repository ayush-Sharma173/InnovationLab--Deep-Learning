Project Summary: Crime Scene Detection Using Machine/Deep Learning

As part of a collaborative team project, I contributed to the development of an enhanced Efficient Residual Audio Neural Network (ERANN) using TensorFlow, aimed at improving audio pattern recognition. Our team designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture specifically to enhance the inference speed and reduce the size of CNN-based systems for audio pattern recognition tasks. This innovative architecture achieved performance that is 7.1 times faster and 9.7 times smaller compared to state-of-the-art systems.

When evaluated on the UrbanSound8K dataset and our proprietary dataset, our model achieved state-of-the-art results with accuracies of 84.4% and 81.9%, respectively. I was responsible for training the audio network on the collected audio dataset and extracting the audio features necessary for further processing. These features were integral to the development of a multimodal system that combines both visual and audio inputs to ensure robust model performance.
